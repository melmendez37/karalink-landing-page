        <h5 class="text-dark text-start text-lg mb-2 p-2 lh-lg ">In 2024, months after the successful launch of KaraCare, a medical emergency system, Mel Mendez noticed areas of Cagayan de Oro City that lacked public transportation. So he seeks help from experts John Lloyd Pendon, and Michael Arcdaniel Estabas, to design and make an application that will solve transportation issues among commuters, especially those traveling late at night. Moreover, the soon-to-be application will also assist with the navigation for locals and tourists alike. Thus, KaraLink was born.</h5>
